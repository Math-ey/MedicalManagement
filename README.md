# Medical Management

This is a school mini project where we created a web application for employee management in hospitals. You can also manage treatments and assign particular employees to them. Only employees and treatments are supported now, institutions and patients are planed to be added in the future.

Web is implemented in Angular and API is written in .Net Core 3.1. The web supports redux patern to hold apps state. API supports pagination and filtering.
